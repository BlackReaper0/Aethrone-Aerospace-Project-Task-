# Machine Learning Projects  
This repository includes two machine learning projects completed by Aethrone Aerospace:  

## 1. Predicting Vehicle CO₂ Emissions  
**Objective:**  
Develop and assess regression models to predict CO₂ emissions based on attributes such as engine size, fuel consumption, and the number of cylinders. The project emphasizes model evaluation using metrics like MAE, RSS, and R², while also covering data preprocessing and comparative analysis of various regression techniques.  

**Key Steps:**  
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers
- Feature scaling through Standardization  
- Conducting correlation analysis for feature selection  
- Training models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- Evaluating model performance with relevant metrics  

## 2. Object Detection in Aerial Maritime Images  
**Objective:**  
Create bounding box annotations and implement an object detection model to identify and classify objects such as boats, cars, and jetskis in maritime environments. The project includes merging similar categories and assessing the performance of different models.  

**Key Steps:**  
- Annotating images for object detection tasks  
- Implementing and fine-tuning detection models  
- Comparing model performance across different object categories
